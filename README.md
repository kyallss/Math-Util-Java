# Math-Util-Java
## Description

This project is a Java implementation of a utility class `MathUtil` and provides a collection of advanced numerical operations. The class contains both static and non-static methods for performing operations such as finding prime numbers, calculating GCD/LCM, Fibonacci sequences, factorials, and other number-based operations.

## Features
The `MathUtil` class includes the following methods:
### Static Methods
1. **isPrime(int n)** - Checks if a given number `n` is a prime number.
2. **gcd(int a, int b)** - Calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. **lcm(int a, int b)** - Computes the least common multiple of two numbers.
4. **fibonacci(int n)** - Returns the Fibonacci number.
5. **factorial(int n)** - Computes the factorial of a number.

### Non-Static Methods
1. **isPerfectNumber(int n)** - Checks if a number is a perfect number (a number equal to the sum of its divisors, excluding itself).
2. **sumOfDigits(int n)** - Computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
3. **reverseNumber(int n)** - Reverses the digits of a given number.
4. **isArmstrongNumber(int n)** - Checks if a number is an Armstrong number (a number equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits).
5. **nextPrime(int n)** - Finds the smallest prime number greater than `n`.
